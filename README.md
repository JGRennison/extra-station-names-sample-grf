# Extra Station Names Sample NewGRF

### Features

* This GRF adds extra station name strings for when all the default names have been used up, instead of "Town Station #NNN".

### Requirements

* This GRF requires a non-standard version of OpenTTD which supports the extra station names feature such as [JGR's patchpack](https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches) v0.42.3 or later.

* There is a parameter to set the probability of using an extra station name before all the default names have been used up. For this parameter to take effect a version of OpenTTD which supports this feature is required, such as [JGR's patchpack](https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches) v0.47.2 or later.

### Development

* Compiling requires a forked verison of NML with additional features from [here](https://github.com/JGRennison/nml).
